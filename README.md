# LRU-and-FIFO-using-OpenGL
This repository contains a Computer Graphics mini-project that simulates the Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithms in an animated form. The project visualizes the page replacement process, highlighting the number of page faults incurred during execution.

Features:

Visualization of LRU and FIFO page replacement algorithms.
Animated representation of page requests and replacements.
Interactive interface allowing users to input page request sequences.
Real-time display of page faults.

Technologies Used:

C programming language
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)
GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

How to Run:

Compile the source code using a C compiler.
Execute the compiled binary to launch the application.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input a sequence of 9 numbers representing page requests.
Press 'F' for FIFO or 'L' for LRU to initiate the respective algorithm.
Observe the animated visualization of the page replacement process and the total number of page faults incurred.

Note:
This project was developed as a part of the Computer Graphics mini-project assignment and serves as a practical demonstration of page replacement algorithms in operating systems. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with different page request sequences to observe the behavior of LRU and FIFO algorithms.
