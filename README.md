# LRU-and-FIFO-using-OpenGL
This repository contains a Computer Graphics mini-project that simulates the Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithms in an animated form. The project visualizes the page replacement process, highlighting the number of page faults incurred during execution.
